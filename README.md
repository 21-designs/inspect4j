# Observe and manipulate your compilations at runtime
Allows to display the current state of any object in your program. But not only observe the current value of class fields, it allows you to apply modifications to all accessible values and see the changes and effects on the fly.
In short this is similar to a simple debugging tool to view an object's state during runtime. In addition any changes done to the introspector will be applied to the currently viewed object.

# Restrict the appearance of the monitored module
Use predefined annotations to style specified class fields and regulate the appearance, as well as the behavior of the displayed element. This is an easy to use feature to create a well customized and unique presentation of the observed module (In this context 'module' means any object or class instantiation).
